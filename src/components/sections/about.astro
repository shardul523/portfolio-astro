        I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering from{" "}
        <a href="http://www.mmmut.ac.in/"
          >Madan Mohan Malviya University of Technology</a
        > in 2024 and am currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering
        from <a href="https://www.iiitb.ac.in/">IIIT Bangalore</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        During my academic journey, I had the opportunity to work on a variety
        of exciting projects, ranging from web applications to mobile apps.
        These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in
        programming languages such as JavaScript and Python, as well as
        expertise in technologies like React and Node.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I have also had the pleasure of interning as a mentor,
        allowing me to gain valuable experience and improve my communication
        abilities.
